# exercise-markdown

In teams of four you have to create a repository called exercise-markdown, in which you will add two files: README.md and markdown.md. README.md will have a description of the repository, as well as, a list of the group’s member. While markdown.md will talk about what’s MarkDown (description, purpose, etc…​) and respect the content section below.
